*Note. N = 2400 observations from 300 participants. This sensitivity model removes the 10-50 CNY range filter but keeps the original Niming prefilters (marker row and age = -999). Because restored raw records do not contain usable trial-order fields, this table controls for perceived image quality, attractiveness, and mood but omits image-memory order and food order. Significance symbols: † p < .10, * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001.*
