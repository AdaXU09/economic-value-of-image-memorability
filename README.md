## Abstract

This research investigates the relationship between image memorability and business performance using large-scale observational data from Yelp and a controlled experiment. We address two primary research questions:

1. **Study 1**: What image features drive memorability?
2. **Study 2**: Does image memorability affect business ratings?
3. **Study 3**: Does image memorability influence consumers' maximum willingness to pay?
